I created a roster for people to create their dream team. This app could be used for sports coaches to create their rosters, fantasy sports players to make their lineup or sports lovers who want to create their own imaginary team.
You just put in the information about the player like their jersey number, player name, nickname, height, position and if they are a starter or not. I tried to make this apply to most/all team sports.
You fill out the info and add the player to the roster and all the info should come up and if you want to delete the previous player you just added you can by hitting delete player. For the CSS positioning, I used design: flex on the input and the buttons and aligned the header 
to the left so everything would be lined up especially the input boxes.
  


## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: The whole webpage is on a single page. The user inputs the info into the boxes
and the info appears on the table below it on the same page.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
I did a study with two of my roommates

First Study:
1. Braen
2. That the info didn't delete after they added a new player and that they weren't 
able to select a player to delete instead of just the last one. 
3. The user liked the gif and that they didn't know if they could just make up names
or had to put names of actual atheletes.
4. In th interface, I would let the info delete after adding a player so theye wouldn't have to double-click
to change the info and allow them to just select a player to delete.

Second Study:
1. Soucy
2. That they weren't able to delete their player of choice. Should have different sports options
at the top of the form. Change the
3. The gif made them dizzy and they didn't know what the starter box meant.
4. I would rephrase the header for the starter input. For example, Are they Starter? Yes Or no? or explain in parentheses what a starter is. Make a option above to choose a specific team sport and delete any player in the table without having to delete ones you don't want to delete.
